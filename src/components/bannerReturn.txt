                      - My last name came from a Lao origin background. Laos is
                      a country in Southeast Asia where there are rich and
                      diverse cultural history that is reflected in its
                      surnames!

                      I am an avid enjoyer to many entertainments, but I also
                      have many love to creation! I love making music,
                      learning/playing the piano, and also writing and creating
                      melodies to beats! Though, when I am not in my creative
                      mode, I like to rewind by playing video games and watch
                      recommended videos on Youtube!

                      I went by Jay more often starting from my old job at CVS.
                      There would be another person name 'Gerry', but also
                      pronounced the same as 'Jerry'. But one of us would be
                      called in the loudspeaker, we would get confused and both
                      of us would go up front to respond even if only one of us
                      was needed. So to clarify the confusion, I went by my
                      nickname, Jay.{' '}
